# neoGraphStack

A starter project for building a Neo4j graph database with a graphQL API and a React frontend.

Includes Docker containers for easy deployment.

## Special Thanks

I would like to give thanks to [William Lyon](https://github.com/johnymontana/) for the inspiration and ['THE' Rob Brennan](https://github.com/TheRobBrennan) for which a lot of the docker images were based on.
